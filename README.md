"# Quintype" 
Framework is designed to end to end using data driven framework of test ng, framework can be directly ran from system
Framework have been designed using rich oops concept of inhertiance and also all paramater are parameteried 
for logging we have used Specification class objects which will log details under project /Logs folder
for reporting have used extend report which can be found under project /report folder(under build partially work now)
still many features are needed to be added due to time constrain 100% completion was not possible, however is working almost 80%
